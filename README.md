# Whispers_tree
This project is made for course named "Decentralized software systems". The idea of this group project was to build a multithreaded "broken telephone" game on top of a given base. The project was completed in a group of four, and my main contribution focused on implementing functionality safeguards to prevent concurrency issues.
